# English-to-Malayalam-Machine-Translation


Since, there arenâ€™t many machine translation tools available for English to Malayalam
translation, there is a need to create one. Rule-based, statistical and neural machine
translation have been used in this field which is the starting point for the creation of
the model.

Here, in this project, I used Google Translator to build a Machine translator for translating text from English to Malayalam. 

I also have build a user interface for the translator.

The interface is given below.

We can also add more languages to which the english text can be translated.
